Lecture notes for MATH70033 Algebraic Curves at Imperial College London, 2024/25.

The notes are not finished and I'll update them every week.

The module is a gentle introduction to algebraic geometry with study of affine and projective plane curves over algebraically closed fields. A key result is BÃ©zout's theorem.
